# NFT Metadata Validator — attested computation

> §10.2 Attested Computation binding for [NFT Metadata Validator](../tools/art-209-nft-metadata-validator.md).

## Executor

Kernel source: `chaingraph/kernels/art-209-nft-metadata-validator.kernel.mjs`. A §18 zkVM compute-integrity
proof, when attached to an artifact this kernel produced, carries these receipt fields:
`type`, `system`, `receiptFormat`, `imageId`, `seal`, `journal` (SPEC.md §18.0).

## Attester

Kernel identity: `sha256:f44568d42f15c3115cd7fa67045fb18872ae4cc0ba789b6bede70f9448176a1b` (SPEC.md §17.1 `compute_images`) — a
content-addressed digest of this node's deployed kernel source, already published in the
Graph Index. Static and dereferenceable; nothing in OpenChainGraph verification depends on
this OKF bundle, and this concept asserts no execution event or `verified:` status.
