# Safe Transaction Hash Recompute — attested computation

> §10.2 Attested Computation binding for [Safe Transaction Hash Recompute](../tools/829-safe-tx-hash-recompute.md).

## Executor

Kernel source: `chaingraph/kernels/829-safe-tx-hash-recompute.kernel.mjs`. A §18 zkVM compute-integrity
proof, when attached to an artifact this kernel produced, carries these receipt fields:
`type`, `system`, `receiptFormat`, `imageId`, `seal`, `journal` (SPEC.md §18.0).

## Attester

Kernel identity: `sha256:60f4ab23d5ec5710081df25793e9ee65e04141114c12d370882a8cc288a54397` (SPEC.md §17.1 `compute_images`) — a
content-addressed digest of this node's deployed kernel source, already published in the
Graph Index. Static and dereferenceable; nothing in OpenChainGraph verification depends on
this OKF bundle, and this concept asserts no execution event or `verified:` status.
