# Anchored Extract Verifier — attested computation

> §10.2 Attested Computation binding for [Anchored Extract Verifier](../tools/art-286-anchored-extract-verifier.md).

## Executor

Kernel source: `chaingraph/kernels/art-286-anchored-extract-verifier.kernel.mjs`. A §18 zkVM compute-integrity
proof, when attached to an artifact this kernel produced, carries these receipt fields:
`type`, `system`, `receiptFormat`, `imageId`, `seal`, `journal` (SPEC.md §18.0).

## Attester

Kernel identity: `sha256:7532df2eced1bf011b8bb608c7ca0038e116d7d554d5439e90d09905d997091c` (SPEC.md §17.1 `compute_images`) — a
content-addressed digest of this node's deployed kernel source, already published in the
Graph Index. Static and dereferenceable; nothing in OpenChainGraph verification depends on
this OKF bundle, and this concept asserts no execution event or `verified:` status.
